**Roomoney** is a simple and user-friendly app designed for roommates. It helps
you keep track of your shared household expenses. You and your roommate can
create a private virtual household together, where you can add, edit, or delete
purchases related to your shared living arrangement. The app provides real-time
visibility into how much each person owes or is owed by the other. If your
living situation changes, you can leave the current virtual household and create
or join a new one. Currently, each user can only be part of one virtual
household at a time, and households can have a maximum of two residents.
However, this may change in the future.

```sh
BASE_URL=localhost:8000
DENO_ENV=development 
COOKIE_SECRET=secret
DB_CONNECTION_STRING=localhost
```

Start the project:

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.

## Usage (deploy / production)

For deployment / production check out [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy).
